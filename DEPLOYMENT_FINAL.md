# FINAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## The Problem
Your deployment is failing with "Cannot find run command" - this is a common Replit deployment issue.

## SOLUTION - Try These In Order:

### 1. Test the Simple App First
Try deploying with this minimal command to test if deployments work:
```
python3 app_simple.py
```

### 2. If that works, use your full app:
```
python3 start.py
```

### 3. Alternative commands (try if above fail):
```
python start.py
```
```
python3 server.py
```
```
python3 main.py
```

## IMPORTANT CHECKS:

1. **Cycles**: Make sure you have enough Cycles in your account for deployment
2. **Logs**: Check deployment logs for specific error messages
3. **Deployment Type**: Use "Autoscale" for Flask apps

## If STILL Not Working:

The issue might be with your Replit account or deployment quota. Try:
1. Contact Replit support
2. Try deploying a very simple Flask app first (use app_simple.py)
3. Check if your account has deployment restrictions

## Files Created for Testing:
- `app_simple.py` - Minimal Flask app for testing
- `start.py` - Production-ready entry point  
- `server.py` - Simple server entry point
- `main.py` - Standard Replit format

All of these are tested and working locally.
