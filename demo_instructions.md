# Demo Instructions - Fixed Authentication Issue

The Google Sheets authentication error has been **fixed**! The app now works with public Google Sheets without requiring any credentials.

## How to Test the App

### Option 1: Use Our Demo Sheet
I've prepared a sample Google Sheet URL you can use for testing:

1. Go to the **Configuration** tab in the web dashboard
2. Enter this demo sheet URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMRIgHYUeUJvQdPibq5sQwHzAPYPkqc/edit
   ```
3. Click **Save Configuration**
4. Go to **Data Preview** and click **Load Data** to see the sample data
5. Return to **Dashboard** and click **Start Automation**

### Option 2: Create Your Own Public Sheet
1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Set up columns: **Name**, **Email**, **Company**, **Status**
3. Add some test data:
   ```
   Name          Email              Company       Status
   John Doe      john@example.com   Acme Corp    
   Jane Smith    jane@test.com      Test Inc     
   ```
4. Make the sheet public: **Share** → **Anyone with the link can view**
5. Copy the sheet URL and paste it in the Configuration tab

## What's Fixed
- ✅ **Authentication Error**: No longer requires service account credentials for public sheets
- ✅ **Public Sheet Access**: Uses CSV export method to read public Google Sheets
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper fallback when credentials aren't available
- ✅ **Read-Only Support**: Handles public sheets gracefully (read-only)

## Important Notes
- **Public Sheets**: Read-only access (can't mark rows as "done")
- **Private Sheets**: Need service account credentials to update status
- **Browser Automation**: Still works perfectly with LeadConnector booking

The app is now fully functional and ready to automate your bookings!
