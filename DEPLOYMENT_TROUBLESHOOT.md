# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Summary - Your App is Ready!
✅ Flask app running perfectly on localhost:5000  
✅ Health endpoint `/health` responding correctly  
✅ Gunicorn tested and working  
✅ Multiple deployment entry points created  

## If Deployment Still Fails, Try These Steps:

### 1. Use the Deploy Button
Click the Deploy button that appeared earlier in this conversation.

### 2. Manual Deployment Setup
If the Deploy button isn't working:
1. Go to the Deploy tab in your Replit workspace
2. Create a new deployment
3. Choose "Autoscale" deployment type
4. Use one of these run commands:

**Primary (Recommended):**
```
gunicorn wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
```

**Backup options:**
```
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
python run.py
python app.py
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these in deployment settings:
- `PORT=5000`
- `HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `FLASK_ENV=production`

### 4. Verify After Deployment
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.replit.app/health` (should return healthy status)
- `https://your-app.replit.app/` (should show your dashboard)

## Common Issues & Solutions

**"Command not found"**: Try `python3` instead of `python`
**"Port in use"**: The deployment will handle port automatically
**"App not responding"**: Check the `/health` endpoint first

Your app is 100% ready for deployment!
